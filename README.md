This repository is part of the effort to create a product for the demorcraton initiative 


## The product ##

We are trying to create a moderated video chat for people with different views, even contradictory views, and strive for a constructive dialogue. 

How do we do that 
- human moderation
- computer base moderation
- [TODO]

## technological challenges  ##

Video chat 
Multi point video chat ( moderator + discussing parties ) 
Recording video 

## the technology ##

When I start developing a product/application I am looking for the most complex element in this product. 
The most common video chat and conferencing solution is WebRTC - it is supported on most modern browsers and has multiple backend tools and solutions. 
I would rather not choose development stack (golang for backend, react for frontend) and than see what tools do I have for this stack to implement video, 
but I would rather look for solution and choose the technological stack that is using this solution. 


### browser support of webrtc ###
